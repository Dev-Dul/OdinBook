## Stuff learned and Improved

* Real-time data fetching - This is the very first project i've built using socket.io for real-time data fetching. It is also my first implementation of real time data fetching, it hasn't been easy, but it greatly helped me improve my real time data fetching skills in a react environment.

* Data fetching - This project greatly helped me improve my data fetching skills in a react environment.

* Session Handling - This project greatly helped my improve utilizing cookies in a react decoupled project to handle sessions. It was really an enlightening experience.

* Authentication - This isn't my first decoupled project using react that fully utilizes passportJS to handle authentication, but it's the first that utilizes a third party Oauth service (in this case Google) as an alternative auth option. I learnt alot from this.
